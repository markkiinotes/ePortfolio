        <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p>This eportfolio page was constructed with only HTML and CSS as the framework.&nbsp; The page formatting, section headers, bubbles and animations where completed using only CSS.  The code was written in Adobe Dreamweaver, my preferred web develpement IDE. </p>
        
        <h3>C++ with SQL</h3>
        <p>The link below provide examples of C++ used with SQL from the CS 405 Secure Coding course. This course focused on techniques to prevent Buffer Overflow, Exceptions, and SQL injections.  In addition, the course offered sound industry standard techniques for debugging, testing and encryption.</p>
        <p>In the example below the task was to read an input file "inputdatafile.txt". The data read for the input file was then encrypted to an independent text file "encrypteddatafile.txt". Once encrypted and written to its independent text file the file was then to be decrypted into another independent file "decrypteddatafile.txt." The output is as shown below. Click the like to view the project files and code.</p>

        <h3>Java</h3>
        <p>This Java course work example "Paint" required the coding of a program which calculate how much paint a user would need to cover a certain square footage of wall. This console based program written in the Eclipse IDE, asks the user for the height and width of a wall to calculate the area. The area is then used with the constant value of to calculate how many cans of paint will be needed. Below in the figure is the user input and the output.</p>

      <h3>Microsoft Visual Basic</h3>
        <p>The H Video project required the design, coding and deployment of software for a video rental store using .NET resourses and Visual Basic.&nbsp; The software first allows the user to input customer information such the customer's Customer ID and returns the customers information as well as all the customer's video rentals.&nbsp; In addition to customer tracking, this application  allowed the video rental store to input and track video inventory by Movie Number, Studio ID and Title.&nbsp; Users can assign the movies to catagories and input the length of the movie.</p>

    <h3>PHP with MySQL</h3>
    <p>This code snippet is from a personal project which inserts a user to the MySQL database bbbng84_m_notes_db when the user clicks the "Register" button on the user registration page.  Pages have been modulizied in order to be reusable on future projects. The PHP first gets all of the user input passed by the user registrations page. The MySQL querie is then build and places in its own variable to be later prepared and binded. The user data is cleaned of extra spaces using the custom function 'sanitize'.  The database connection is opened, statement prepared and binded then, executed.  After execution, the insert is verified using the user's username and email address. The user id is them pulled from the row and placed in the 'userid' variable.</p>

    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>This is an updated version to the Java program. The objective was to improve the coding and the look of the user interface of a previous project. I decided to use the Java program "Paint" which was initially written to output data to the console. Using Python's tkinter textboxes and window was the idea to improve the user interface. </p>
    <p>Once the user interface was constructed, the improvements to the code was translated to Python from Java. Also added we industry standard checking for the proper user input as well as the proper formatting of the input. Another improvement was an insert function which added the users calculations to a MySQL database to store for future recall in case the user wanted to access previous calculations. The figure below shows the interface </p>
