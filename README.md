This repository is a collection of works to display my knowledge in the areas of design and programming. The Paint project was originally written in Java. Its purpose is to calculate the paint necessary to cover a given spuare footage then, convert that amount into how many cans will be needed. To enhance the project, I was transferred into Python and given an interface. This interface displays the calculations then adds them to a database via mysql.
